# Kartoffel

Starter pack for a ðŸ¥” [kartoffels](https://github.com/Patryk27/kartoffels/) ðŸ¥”
bot.

## Usage

Run `./build` (Linux / Mac) or `build.bat` (Windows) and then upload
`./kartoffel` to [the game](https://kartoffels.pwy.io).

Note that this repository implements a simple robot that'll probably get killed
quite fast - in order to survive, get creative!

## Caveat Emptor

When implementing a kartoffel you're essentially creating a firmware, so you
don't have access to `std` - no `std::fs`, no `println!()` etc.

You can communicate through `serial_send()`, though, and you can use various
fancy structures like `Vec` through the `alloc` crate.

You're given 64 KHz CPU and 128 KiB of RAM, have fun.
